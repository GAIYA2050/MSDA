# MSDA
### A soft version of MSDA

This repo has implemented digits classification experiments in the paper: Multiple Source Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Learning[https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09684]
Thanks to the code from https://github.com/pumpikano/tf-dann , This repo has referenced much of the code there and this code is currently a simple extension from his code.

There a lot of codes that can be written more elegently so if you are interested, feel free to pull requests.


## Experiments Results.
On digits Classifaction, I have runed two experiments and have received satisfactory results.
